# Fedora Result Submit Method
# Default is no submit.  Other options are 'anonymous' where we get results
# without requiring FAS authentication, or 'authenticated' which will use
# FAS authentication to upload and give you credit towards Fedora Badges.

submit=none
# submit=anonymous
# submit=authenticated

# Check duplication tests
# disable_retest=y

# Check Signature for Secure Boot
# checksig=y
# validsig="Fedora Secure Boot Signer"

# Test 3rd Party Modules

# FAS User credentials.
# Storing your FAS password here is technically possible, but not advisable
# for security seasons

# username=''
# password=''
